#####EF080 Squashfs filesystem
Partition extracted using <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch">sasquatch</a>.

The extracted folder has base linux file system with some empty folders and links to file system, and some important files.
List of folders:
```bash
bin  dev  etc  init  lib  mnt  proc  sbin  tmp  usr  var
```

important files are inside /etc:

1.defaultcfg.xml > an encrypted configuration file, a very important file which has all usernames and passwords of  the system and the default settings of the device.
I've looked into a project to decrypt the configuration file from a similar system <a href="http://hg658c.wordpress.com">hg658c.wordpress.com</a> and found that it's not easy, you need some keys and RSAs, these keys should be stored somewhere in the system.

2.webimg > the content of the website, it consists of html asp xml css files, but all the files are stacked in one file

3.webidx > is the index for the files which is stacked in webimg, the content of this file as follows:
path:html
webfilterparam.h 39663 0
path:html/html
pubinfo.asp 1279 39663
msgerrcode.asp 1347 40942

path:html > is the path of the following files
webfilterparam.h > is the file name
39663 > is the file size
0 > is the decimal starting position of the file

I've made a python script to extract the webimg files in my Github, you have to download readwebimg.py and copy it beside the webidx and webimg, and run it using the terminal:
```bash
$ python readwebimg.py
```
it will extract all files inside html folder

####Things you need to know:

Note: you need to replace the brackets with the text inside (*****) to the suitable variable.

To extract a part of a firmware image use:
```bash
$ dd if=(imageName) bs=1 skip=(decimal address of the beginning of the file) of=(outPartName)
```

To check the file type use:
```bash
$ file (the name of the file you need to check)
```

To read all strings in a file use:
```bash
$ strings -n 10 (the name of the file you need to check)  >  (name_of_the_output_file)
```

To read a file in hex form including a space with (*) to indicate a repeated code use:
```bash
$ hexdump -C (the name of the file you need to check)  >  (name_of_the_output_file)
```

You can limit the hex form lines to a certain number of lines using:
```bash
$  hexdump -C (the name of the file you need to check) | head -n (number of requested lines)
```

To search for a file name in a directory and its subdirectories use:
```bash
$ find . -name (the name of the wanted file)
```

To search for a text inside the files in a directory and its subdirectories use:
```bash
$ grep "(the wanted text)" -r .
```
