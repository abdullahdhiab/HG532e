Things you need to know:

Note: you need to replace the brackets with the text inside (*****) to the suitable variable.

To extract a part of a firmware image use:
$ dd if=(imageName) bs=1 skip=(decimal address of the beginning of the file) of=(outPartName)

To check the file type use:
$ file (the name of the file you need to check)

To read all strings in a file use:
$ strings -n 10 (the name of the file you need to check)  >  (name_of_the_output_file)

To read a file in hex form including a space with (*) to indicate a repeated code use:
$ hexdump -C (the name of the file you need to check)  >  (name_of_the_output_file)

You can limit the hex form lines to a certain number of lines using:
$  hexdump -C (the name of the file you need to check) | head -n (number of requested lines)

To search for a file name in a directory and its subdirectories use:
$ find . -name (the name of the wanted file)

To search for a text inside the files in a directory and its subdirectories use:
$ grep "(the wanted text)" -r .
